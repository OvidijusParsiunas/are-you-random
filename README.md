A browser game that tests how predictable your "random" choices really are.

Try to beat the machine by being unpredictable. The computer uses pattern recognition to predict your next move.

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate that humans are not as random as they think. We tend to fall into patterns without realizing it.

## 🎮 Play

https://ovidijusparsiunas.github.io/are-you-random

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Pick a number (2-6 choices available)
2. The machine tries to predict your choice
3. You score if it guesses wrong; the machine scores if it's right

## :robot: Algorithms

- **Markov Chain** - Predicts based on patterns in your recent choices
- **Neural Network** - A TensorFlow.js model that learns your behavior

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
